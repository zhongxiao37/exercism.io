# Kindergarten Garden

Given a diagram, determine which plants each child in the kindergarten class is
responsible for.

The kindergarten class is learning about growing plants. The teachers
thought it would be a good idea to give them actual seeds, plant them in
actual dirt, and grow actual plants.

They've chosen to grow grass, clover, radishes, and violets.

To this end, they've put little styrofoam cups along the window sills,
and planted one type of plant in each cup, choosing randomly from the
available types of seeds.

```plain
[window][window][window]
........................ # each dot represents a styrofoam cup
........................
```

There are 12 children in the class:

- Alice, Bob, Charlie, David,
- Eve, Fred, Ginny, Harriet,
- Ileana, Joseph, Kincaid, and Larry.

Each child gets 4 cups, two on each row. The children are assigned to
cups in alphabetical order.

The following diagram represents Alice's plants:

```plain
[window][window][window]
VR......................
RG......................
```

So in the row nearest the window, she has a violet and a radish; in the
row behind that, she has a radish and some grass.

Your program will be given the plants from left-to-right starting with
the row nearest the windows. From this, it should be able to determine
which plants belong to which students.

For example, if it's told that the garden looks like so:

```plain
[window][window][window]
VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV
VRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV
```

Then if asked for Alice's plants, it should provide:

- Violets, radishes, violets, radishes

While asking for Bob's plants would yield:

- Clover, grass, clover, clover

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/ruby).

For running the tests provided, you will need the Minitest gem. Open a
terminal window and run the following command to install minitest:

    gem install minitest

If you would like color output, you can `require 'minitest/pride'` in
the test file, or note the alternative instruction, below, for running
the test file.

In order to run the test, you can run the test file from the exercise
directory. For example, if the test suite is called
`hello_world_test.rb`, you can run the following command:

    ruby hello_world_test.rb

To include color from the command line:

    ruby -r minitest/pride hello_world_test.rb
